Simple demo for LSTM

 
## Purpose


The Long Short-Term Memory network, or LSTM network, is a recurrent neural network that is trained using Backpropagation Through Time and overcomes the vanishing gradient problem.
As such, it can be used to create large recurrent networks that in turn can be used to address difficult sequence problems in machine learning and achieve state-of-the-art results.
Instead of neurons, LSTM networks have memory blocks that are connected through layers.

The notebook "Time series prediction with LSTM (IOT Data) with keras.ipynb"introduces the LSTM algorithm, and applies it to Time Series Prediction for Solar_power_forecasting
